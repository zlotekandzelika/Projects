This project analyses a national river toxin dataset to evaluate pollution levels across different river systems. The data is cleaned by handling missing values, converting dates, and preparing numeric variables for analysis. Average concentrations of lead, mercury, and arsenic are calculated to identify overall toxin levels and the most polluted rivers. Time-series and bar chart visualisations are used to explore how toxin levels vary across rivers and over time. Correlation analysis and heatmaps help identify relationships between environmental variables. Statistical testing and linear regression are applied to compare toxin levels between rivers and examine the relationship between lead concentration and pH levels.
