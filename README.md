1. Global Superstore

This project analyses the Global Superstore dataset to understand sales performance, profitability, and customer trends across regions and product categories. Using Python, the data was cleaned, transformed, and explored to identify top-selling products, regional sales patterns, and relationships between sales, profit, and discounts. Time-series analysis was applied to evaluate monthly sales trends and seasonality, while visualisations such as bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, and decomposition plots supported insight generation. The analysis highlights key revenue drivers, regional performance differences, and the impact of discounts on profitability to support data-driven business decisions.


2. National River Toxin Analysis 
 
This project analyses a national river toxin dataset to evaluate pollution levels across different river systems. The data is cleaned by handling missing values, converting dates, and preparing numeric variables for analysis. Average concentrations of lead, mercury, and arsenic are calculated to identify overall toxin levels and the most polluted rivers. Time-series and bar chart visualisations are used to explore how toxin levels vary across rivers and over time. Correlation analysis and heatmaps help identify relationships between environmental variables. Statistical testing and linear regression are applied to compare toxin levels between rivers and examine the relationship between lead concentration and pH levels.

3. Clinical Trial Data Analysis

This project involved an end-to-end analysis of randomised controlled trial data to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel diabetes medication. Using patient-level clinical data, the analysis assessed changes in HbA1c levels compared to placebo while monitoring adverse events across demographic subgroups. Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and statistical modelling were applied to identify treatment effects, subgroup differences, and safety signals. The results demonstrated statistically significant HbA1c reductions with a favourable safety profile, supporting regulatory and commercial decision-making.
